## get started

it's very easy to get started. first you will need ffmpeg/ffprobe installed and on PATH.

**[heres a good tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-ffmpeg-on-windows/) you can use to do that.**


then you can do one of two things:

- [download a prebuilt binary](github.com/charlesispi/ttliverip/releases/latest) to use
- run the script itself with python

if you want to do the second option, then scroll down to the section i have on that, titled "run using python"

if you want do the first option, then once you download the zip, extract it. then open a cmd window or powershell in that unzipped directory. then type in:

`./ttliverip`

if you did it correctly, you should see a usage prompt. you are all good.

## use script from source

if you want to run the program from the source code, then follow these instructions.

***you'll need python 3.8.7 or later installed and on the PATH***

first download the source code which shouldn't be too hard. extract it. then open the folder in cmd/powershell. then do these commands:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python ttliverip.py
```
if you did it correctly, you should see a usage prompt. you are all good.
